We can see the mean runtime of the 1,000 movies, roughly 113 minutes, along with the standard deviation and percentiles in the runtime, rating, revenue, and Metascore of the movies. We also see the average rating, roughly 6.7/10, and the minimum and maximum revenue, which, to clarify, is the domestic revenue, not the worldwide revenue. We can see the movie from the list with the highest revenue was roughly 937 million dollars, and the movie it says with the lowest revenue was zero dollars. When I looked online, this wasn't correct since the movie from the list that it says made zero dollars was a movie called **A Kind of Murder**. This movie actually made $2,915 domestically. Because of this, the movies at the bottom for revenue are slightly off but still close to being accurate."

What we're also doing beyond specifying the years for movies in which they came out, is that we're also specifying that the movie has to have a rating of below six along with revenue being in the 0.80 quantile.

    "Here, I have organized the highest-grossing movies from the list regarding revenue and looked for a correlation. What we can see from this chart is that movies with the highest domestic revenue don't have a common director that's dominating the list, but they have a common genre. Almost all of these movies have the same couple of related genres: **Action**, **Adventure**, and **Sci-Fi**. You could also sprinkle in **Fantasy** and **Comedy**, but the other three are the main staples. \n",
    "So, when looking at the top 1,000 IMDb movies from 2006-2016, we can see a correlation between the movies with the highest revenue and their genre. There's also some fascinating insight into movies with low Metascore ratings that still have a high revenue. For example, when we printed out movies with a rating below six and were at the 0.80 quantile in revenue, we saw movies such as **Fifty Shades of Grey** bringing in 166.15 million dollars even with a 4.1 rating. We also had **Transformers: Age of Extinction** with a rating of 5.7 that brought in 245.43 million dollars. So, just because a movie has a low rating doesn't mean there's no potential to make a lot of money at the box office."
