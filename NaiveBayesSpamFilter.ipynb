    "# Building a Spam Filter with Naive Bayes\n",
    "***\n",
    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will build a spam filter for SMS messages using the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. We aim to write a program that classifies new messages with an accuracy greater than 90% — so we expect that more than 90% of the new messages will be classified correctly as spam or ham (non-spam).\n",
    "\n",
    "To train our algorithm, we will use a dataset of 5,572 pre-classified (spam vs. non-spam) text messages. The dataset can be downloaded from [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection). When it comes to training the algorithm, we'll be teaching it how to classify messages from the perspective of a human as accurately as possible. This means we want the algorithm to see text messages through our eyes as humans would when we look at a message and can tell whether it's spam. With this knowledge, the algorithm will classify new messages and tell us how many are spam or ham. It's based on probability, and the algorithm combines everything it learns to make it as accurate as possible."
