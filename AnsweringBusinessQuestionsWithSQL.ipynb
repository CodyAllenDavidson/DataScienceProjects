    "This analysis uses the [Chinook](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database) database. The Chinook database is a fictional digital media shop based on actual data from an iTunes library. We will be looking at sales in terms of individual tracks vs. albums, along with sales by country and many more variables. The goal is to see what Chinook can do as a company to maximize profits for its digital media shop."

Since there are some countries in our database with only one customer, it's better to group them into their own category. Hence, the **Other** name under the country column is all those countries with only one customer. It makes more sense to put the country's name in this list if they have at least two or more customers.\n",

One piece of data that stands out here is that the Czech Republic has the highest average order value by far and away. Adding onto that, what's interesting is that they only have two customers, which means those two customers were hungry for new music to listen to. Other countries such as Portugal and India had the second and third highest average order amounts while only having two customers each. With this in mind, these three countries are perfect for targeting those countries' music audiences to maximize profit since they're so willing to purchase a lot of songs/albums."

The thing with this data is that customers can only either purchase individual tracks or whole albums. Since Chinook has to be specific with what tracks and albums they want to get the rights to sell in their store, the issue is that customers aren't allowed to purchase an album along with individual tracks all in the same purchase. Management is considering letting customers purchase only the most popular tracks from each album from record companies instead of being able to purchase every track from an album. With this in mind, we need to see customers' buying habits in terms of whether they're buying more tracks than albums or vice versa. "

So, seeing the most popular artists in the Chinook database being from the 14th most popular genre isn't what we expected. With this information, it's not a good idea to focus on these top artists and selling their individual tracks since, yes, they're in the highest number of playlists, but classical music is nowhere near one of the top genres."

    "After analyzing the Chinook database and trying to find answers to help the company maximize profits, we've come up with the following findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They should purchase the three albums mentioned earlier, which are **Red Tone**, which was in the Punk genre, **Slim Jim Bites** in the Blues genre, and **Meteor and the Girls**, which was in the Pop genre. These three genres were the highest among the four in the overall most popular genres in Chinook's digital media shop. They need to capitalize on what's popular and push these three albums.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Of the three sales agents, **Jane Peacock** was the most successful, with **Steve Johnson** on pace with her. **Margaret Park** was the least successful of the three sales agents, so one idea would be to focus on Jane and Steve taking on the more essential customers regarding how much money those customers are spending. If the customer is looking to buy a lot of individual tracks which leads to them spending more money than the average customer, statistically speaking, it would be wiser to have Jane or Steve deal with those more higher profile customers that're willing to spending more money since Chinook needs those purchases to go through.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Out of all the countries, the USA has the highest percentage of total customers and sales, so focusing on the USA when it comes to bringing more attention to helping those customers out with their purchases will help in an increase in revenue. Another aspect to consider when it comes to countries and music is that the Czech republic had the highest average order value by quite a lot. Portugal and India did as well, but those countries only had two customers who bought from Chinook. What could be done with these countries since there's clear potential for higher sales since the customers are willing to spend a lot is to implement ads more in those countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customers, by far and away, buy individual tracks compared to albums, so focusing on purchasing the most popular individual tracks for their digital media shop is imperative to maximize profits. This is because customers have to weigh whether they want to purchase an album or individual tracks more since that's their policy that you can't double dip. So, purchasing popular individual tracks from the record companies from the most popular genres will help them maximize profits. We did see that the artists in the most playlists were in the classical genre, but the classical genre is the 14th most popular and is near the bottom of the list. Because of this, it's noted to not focus on those artists and push their individual tracks as a great way to maximize profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "- About half of the individual tracks weren't purchased, which could come down to them being in less popular genres. Yes, it's important to have a range of tracks across multiple genres, but if we have to be picky in the number of individual tracks we can purchase from record companies, we want to focus on what's popular genre-wise. We can see from the classical genre, which is a perfect example, that the most popular artists, when it came to the number of playlists, were a part of a genre that most people didn't care for."
